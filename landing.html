												<h3>Systems Engineer at ITI Operations Ltd</h3>
											</header>
											<p>ITI provide bespoke control and data management systems to a large catalog of clients in the energy sector. Based in their Glasgow office I worked as part of a small team that provide robust long-life systems to several nuclear and hydroelectric sites in the UK. I interacted with customers throughout all stages of a projects lifecycle and as a result I was required to maintain good client relationships as well as present complex information in an accessible manner.</p>
											<p>Technical requirements of the role included: writing, modifying, and troubleshooting programs and scripts written in VBA, C, HTML, SQL, Powershell and batch files; Configure and manage servers and PCs with a variety of operating systems (VMWare ESXi, Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019, windows 7 & 10); utilise a wide variety of off the shelf software components in order to provide bespoke solutions for clients (WinCC, MS SQL Server, OPC-DA, OPC-UA, SSH); PLC hardware installation and programming. I have also performed rigorous validation testing of several systems verifying their security and robustness are suitable to meet the high standards set by the nuclear industry.</p>
											<p>Latterly I was promoted to a project manager position, managing all support and maintenance contracts out of the Glasgow office for a range of systems and clients.</p>

												<h3>Research Assistant at The University of Glasgow</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Following MEng thesis, I was asked to return and work as part of my projects research team. The projectâ€™s primary focus was on the creation of a novel, low-cost instrumentation and control system for a small-scale biomass gasification plant based on real time tar detection. </p>
											<p>The role incorporated many engineering skills focusing of controls system instrumentation and hardware design as well computer and microprocessor programming. I was Required to perform extensive data analysis to tune a control algorithm and increase system efficiency. I carried out a series of complex experiments along with my colleagues publishing our findings in journals and conference papers.</p>

												<h3>Mechanical Engineering MEng at The University of Glasgow</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I Studied modules covering a range of engineering principals and applied mathematics. I the applied this knowledge to various complex systems to model them both mathematically and computationally using a variety of programming languages and software suits. (Matlab, Solidworks, Silum8, Ansys, processing and Abaqus)</p>
											<p>During this time I was placed on the list of students who achieved Engineering Excellence for three out of four years of study in Glasgow</p>
											<p>My course also included an exchange year at the University of Toronto (2015-2016), which at the time had the number one engineering program in Canada.</p>
